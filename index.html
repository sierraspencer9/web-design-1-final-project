            <h2>Hello and welcome to my bio!</h2>
            <h3>about me.</h3>
            <p>My name is sierra and I am currently a student of Graphic Design
                at Algonquin Colleg</p>

                <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design
                    principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools,
                    including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma,
                    and Sketch.</p>

                    <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have
                        also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as
                        motion graphics and web design.
                        </p>
