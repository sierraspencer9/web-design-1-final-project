<h1>Hello and welcome to my bio!</h1>
<h2>about me.</h2>

<p>My name is sierra and I am currently a student of Graphic Design
    at Algonquin College.</p>
   
    <p>Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design
        principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools,
        including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma,
        and Sketch.</p>
        
        <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have
            also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as
            motion graphics and web design.
            </p>
